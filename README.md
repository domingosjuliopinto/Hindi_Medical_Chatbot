## Introduction

Language is a very important thing in this world. Language is the core need of humans which
helps us bond together, talk to people, understand each other and do many more things. Many
people in the world only know one language that is their mother tongue. In a country like India,
many people mostly in the north and the central region of India, people mostly know only hindi
or the regional language used in their region. Many people who aren’t educated or are educated
in hindi medium prefer to communicate or read and write in hindi. The information provided on
the internet or the chatbots only facilitate or use English as their primary language which makes
it difficult for people who don’t know hindi to understand and process the information. Many
people in this region want to know or get information about various diseases or health related
issues. But due to the information available in English, it's difficult for the people to understand
and process the information. So in order to solve all this problem we made a Health
chatbot in Hindi which will help people to get information in Hindi about various health diseases,
symptoms and home remedies to cure the disease.
